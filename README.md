### Hi there, thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm passionate about leveraging my data-driven insights to inform and drive impactful business decisions while aiming to create positive outcomes for people :sunny:

#### ðŸ”­ Take a look at my projects:
- E-Commerce with Neural Network: [Women Clothes Review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Katherineweiting/E-Commerce-Review-Sentiment-Analysis/tree/main) - Built a LSTM network using pytorch to predict user ratings on items
- Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning: [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Katherineweiting/Predict-Hotel-Booking-Cancellation) - Established key business metric and deployment measures addressing customer churn. Utilized and evaluated supervised learning models: logistic regression, SVM, and Random Forest.


#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- [Time Series](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/time-series): Just found great learning resources on Kaggle âœ¨


#### :car: Past projects @ Audi / Volkswagen Group Taiwan
